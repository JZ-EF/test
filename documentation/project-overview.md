# Strategic Workforce Planning - Customer Support Digital Twin

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) system for a Customer Support function, based on the Eightfold AI framework. The goal is to create a "digital twin" of the workforce that can simulate various scenarios and provide actionable insights for workforce optimization.

## Key Business Questions to Answer

1. **Workforce Reduction**: If I want to cut agent workforce by x%, who should I cut?
2. **AI Augmentation**: I need to use AI Agents to reduce costs. How can I do this?
3. **Capacity Planning**: If AI Agents only help take away specific tasks of a person's role, what can I do with 10 people at 80% capacity?
4. **Skills Gap Analysis**: What critical skills will be missing under different workforce scenarios?
5. **Reskilling Effectiveness**: How effective is reskilling or redeployment in mitigating workforce cuts?

## Eightfold SWP Framework (3 Phases)

### Phase 1: Demand Trigger
- HR Talent Intelligence: High turnover, critical skills gaps
- Strategic/Business Model Shifts: New market entry, cost reduction, M&A, technology transformation
- Planning & Budgeting Cycles: Annual/quarterly reviews

### Phase 2: Supply Availability
- Existing Supply: Inventory of roles, tasks, skills, proficiency levels by employment type, location, costs
- Potential Supply: AI/Automation potential, talent acquisition opportunities

### Phase 3: Scenario & Execution
- Simulation Engine: Run scenarios for hiring, reskilling, redeployment, contingent talent, AI/automation
- Workflow Process: Review, align, and execute prioritized actions with real-time monitoring
